# Etch-a-Sketch 
## The Odin Project DOM manipulation/ JS project


I built a browser-based Etch-A-Sketch toy using DOM manipulation and JavaScript, and I'm excited to share it with you! 
This project challenged me to use my skills to create a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript
and add interactive features such as a hover effect and color change. 
I implemented a feature to generate a new grid with a specified number of squares per side, and added extra credit challenges
to randomize the squares' colors and introduce a progressive darkening effect.
